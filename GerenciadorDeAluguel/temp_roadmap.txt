Suggested TDD Roadmap
1. Complete Value Objects Layer
Start with more foundational value objects:

Address - Street, city, zip code, country validation
Email / PhoneNumber - Contact information with validation
Document (CPF/CNPJ) - Tenant/owner identification

2. Core Domain Entities
Build the main entities test-first:

Property - The rental unit (address, type, size, monthly rent as Money)
Tenant - Person renting (name, contact, document)
Owner - Property owner
Lease - Contract linking tenant to property (uses Period, Money for rent)

3. Domain Services / Business Rules
RentCalculator - Calculate rent with adjustments, late fees
LeaseValidator - Validate lease terms, overlapping periods
PaymentProcessor - Track payments, generate receipts

4. Application Layer (Use Cases)
